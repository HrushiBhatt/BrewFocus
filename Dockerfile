# One image for the whole app: the Go server serves the API and the built Angular app.
# It's a multi-stage build, so Node and the Go compiler are used to build but never shipped.
# Base images are pinned by digest, so a build can't silently pick up a replaced image.
# Dependabot proposes new digests weekly (.github/dependabot.yml).

# 1. Build the Angular frontend.

# 2. Build the Go server. The SQLite driver is pure Go, so CGO can stay off and this makes one
# static binary with nothing else to install. -trimpath and -s -w drop build paths and debug data.

# 3. The runtime: only the binary and the built app, running as a non-root user. There's no shell
# or package manager for an attacker to use. This works because the Go build above is fully static.
